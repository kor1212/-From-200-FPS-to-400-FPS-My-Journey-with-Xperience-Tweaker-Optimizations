🔧 Key Tweaks with Xperience Tweaker
(Free, open-source tool inspired by community scripts like Ancel's Performance Batch 7)

🛠️ System Optimization

Disabled background telemetry & non-essential services (e.g., Cortana, Xbox Game Bar).

Prioritized CPU/GPU resources for gaming via registry tweaks.

Enabled Ultimate Performance power plan for max clock stability 1113.

🎮 Game-Ready Configs

NVIDIA Control Panel:

Set Low Latency Mode → Ultra + Max Performance power mode 11.

Enabled DLSS (Balanced mode) for AI-powered FPS boosts in supported titles 🚀.

AMD 5700X3D Tuning:

Used Kombo Strike 3 (MSI BIOS feature) for undervolting + stability 4.

BCLK Overclocking to 102MHz (safely bypassed AMD’s voltage locks) 26.

🧹 Clean System Maintenance

Regularly cleared temporary files & disabled bloatware.

Monitored thermals with HWInfo64 (CPU temps <75°C under load) ❄️.

📈 Performance Gains
Game (1080p)	Stock FPS	Post-Tweak FPS
CS:GO	200	450+ 🚀
Apex Legends	160	320
Cyberpunk 2077	70	110
Note: Results vary based on game optimization and hardware lottery!

💡 Pro Tips for Maximum FPS
RAM Matters: Tighten timings (e.g., 16-16-16-36) for Ryzen’s 3D V-Cache 6.

Driver Updates: Always use DDU for clean GPU driver installs.

Monitor Refresh Rate: Match in-game FPS cap to your display’s max Hz (e.g., 144Hz → 144 FPS cap).

Malware Scans: Use Malwarebytes to kill hidden resource hogs 3.
